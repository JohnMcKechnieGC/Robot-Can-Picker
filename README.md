# Robot Can Picking Challenge
This project uses the robot can picking challenge from Complexity: A Guided Tour by Melanie Mitchell, 2009, 2009, Oxford University Press, USA, p131.
Several 'robots' are tested, including one evolved using a genetic algorithm that displays similar behaviour to that described in the book.

The following files can be executed directly:
1. main.py - Evaluates a selection of robots
2. test_drive.py - Examine the behaviour of a specific robot
3. genetic_algorithm.py - Evolve a robot controller, compatible with LookupTableRobot
4. optimize_q_learner.py - Find optimal hyperparameters for training the QLearningRobot
