# Robot Can Picking Challenge
This project uses the robot can picking challenge from Complexity: A Guided Tour by Melanie Mitchell, 2009, 2009, Oxford University Press, USA, p131.
Several 'robots' are tested, including one evolved using a genetic algorithm that displays similar behaviour to that described in the book.

The following files can be executed directly:
 - main.py - Evaluates a selection of robots
 - test_drive.py - Examine the behaviour of a specific robot
 - optimize_q_learner.py - Find optimal hyperparameters for training the QLearningRobot

There is also notebook genetic_algorithm.ipynb which evolves a robot controller, compatible with LookupTableRobot.
