# Robot Can Picking Challenge
This project uses the robot can picking challenge from Complexity: A Guided Tour by Melanie Mitchell, 2009, 2009, Oxford University Press, USA, p131.
Several 'robots' are tested, including one evolved using a genetic algorithm that displays similar behaviour to that described in the book.
